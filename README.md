It was an basic application that will be used in Facebook Meetups. 
The application has a functionality to take a CSV file of Users registered for the MeetUp and imports it into a database and have a
screen for admin where he can see all users with their information filled on forms and select users for sending invitation according 
to their previous and recent data.

An email with a unique QR code for all of these selected attendees which will then be sent to them.

On Android app
when attendees going to attend event admin can scan all the QR codes of attendees then posts them to the server after 
collecting them so that we can track who all turned up for the event and who did not.

It has some other functionality as WalkIn feature where admin can add Users + to see the list of users who registered for event,invited users,
attendees and users who attend previous event from a event list page.
